A place to hold tabulated data showing, grouped by model size perhaps, which papers have had what impact on which benchmarks.

A "simple" answer to the question of "If I want to maximize X, what is the most effective approach for me to follow?"

Also provides data to build upon to track/analyse the change in benchmark performance across model sizes, versions and more?
